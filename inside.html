			<h2> Inside </h2>
			<p></p>

			

			<p>Atalissa will tell you: The men never complained.</p>

			<p>People just assumed that the schoolhouse's immaculate exterior mirrored a similar order inside. They say they had little else to go on, since those invitations to Christmas parties had been replaced by No Trespassing signs.</p>

			<p>Even so, warnings kept sounding. In 1979, an investigation by The Des Moines Register strongly suggested that the Henry's program took advantage of men with disabilities. Mr. Johnson defended his operation as a success unfettered by bureaucratic nonsense, and explained that these "boys" might otherwise be wasting away in institutions.</p>
   			

   			<p>But nothing changed. Henry's Turkey Service continued as a for-profit business that limited freedom and used punishment to foster good behavior and a productive work ethic. Men could be banished to their rooms, and forbidden to watch television or listen to music.</p>

   			<p>"You had to do some things like that to make the boys bathe, to make the boys brush their teeth, to change clothes," Mr. Henry says. "The same thing as you would do with a 12-year-old." </p>


   			<p>Some men escaped their drudgery by looking forward to the annual county fair, or watching a University of Iowa football game. Others simply escaped.</p>

   			<p>Gene Berg first ran away in 1981. After attending his father's funeral in Texas, he was sent back to Iowa by his mother, only to hitchhike his way home a couple of days later. Taken by a kindly trucker to a rest stop outside Dallas, Mr. Berg had 25 cents, a Bible and his mother's phone number scribbled on paper. </p>


   			<p>Another time, he says, the supervisors were riding the men too hard with "You're too lazy to do this, too lazy to do that" kind of talk. So he bought some Honey Buns and other supplies, waited for the right moment, then slipped under the cold curtain of night.</p>

   			<p> <img src="image12.jpg" align="right" style="border-radius: 10px" width="750px"> </p>

   			<p>Although caught before he got too far, he says, he still cherishes this distant snatch of freedom. Hiding and shivering in a culvert beside the main road. Laughing to himself as he ate Honey Bun after Honey Bun.</p>

   			<p>Mr. Berg wasn't alone. A man named Alford Busby Jr. is remembered for having a limp, for unloading turkeys on the live dock and for disappearing into a morning snowstorm in January 1987.</p>

  
   			<p>"And away he went," Mr. Henry says. "We never did know why."</p>

			<P>But the men knew. Mr. Busby had been sent to his room for not doing some job properly, Mr. Levi says. "And he say, 'No, I'm not going to bed, I'm going to watch TV like everybody else.'" </P>
			
			<p>"They pissed him off,"" Mr. Wilkins says. "And he walked out."</p>

			<p>Local officials searched the wintry landscape without success. Three months later, during the spring thaw, a farmer found a body along a field's fence row, a quarter-mile from the main road. Mr. Busby was 37, or maybe 43.</p>
			
			<p>"Mentally retarded man wandered away from home in subzero temperature," his death certificate says, citing hypothermia.</p>

			<p>His body was returned to his mother in Texas. But a memorial plaque planted on the Atalissa schoolhouse's front lawn kept the fate of Alford Busby fresh in the minds of those he left behind.</p>
